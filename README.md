# Webster's Bot

[@WebstersBot](https://telegram.me/WebstersBot) — is a [Telegram bot](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) that uses Webster’s Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 + 1828) to send words definitions. 

The work inspired by James Somers' article [“You’re probably using the wrong dictionary”](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary). 

Bot is uploaded on Google App Engine and was configured following the instructions [here](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot).
